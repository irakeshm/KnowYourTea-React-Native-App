    "description": "Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation process used to make oolong teas and black teas. Green tea originated in China, but its production and manufacture has spread to many other countries in Asia. Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially based on the variety of C. sinensis used, growing conditions, horticultural methods, production processing, and time of harvest.",
    "description1": "While all green tea originates from the same plant species, there are different types of green tea grown and produced all over the world today, including China, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Hawaii and even South Carolina. Green tea, however, is considered to have originated in China. It is said that even today the word “tea” in China refers only to green tea, not to the general category of tea as it does in the West. China’s Yunnan province is considered to be the original home of the Camellia sinensis plant species. In fact, 260 of the world’s 380+ varieties of tea can be found in Yunnan. One popular legend suggests that Shennong, Emporor of China and supposed inventor of Chinese medicine, discovered tea as a beverage around 2737 BC when fresh tea leaves from a nearby tea tree fell into his cup of just boiled water. Others credit various Buddhists in the 500s BC and subsequent centuries for the discovery of tea. Buddhists would travel between India and China spreading their religion, culture and ritual of tea. Buddhist monks grew, harvested and produced tea much like their Catholic counterparts in European monasteries did with grapes and wine. The monks’ habit of tea drinking for physical refreshment, to aid meditation and as a substitute for alcohol developed into a spiritual and social practice that spread across China.",
    "description2": "For green tea, the tea leaves are harvested from the Camellia sinensis plant and are then quickly heated—by pan firing or steaming—and dried to prevent too much oxidation from occurring that would turn the green leaves brown and alter their fresh-picked flavor. A brewed green tea is typically green, yellow or light brown in color, and its flavor profile can range from grass-like and toasted (pan fired) to vegetal, sweet and seaweed-like (steamed). If brewed correctly, most green tea should be quite light in color and only mildly astringent. By contrast, black tea leaves are harvested and allowed to fully oxidize before they are heat-processed and dried. During oxidation, oxygen interacts with the tea plant’s cell walls, turning the leaves the rich dark brown to black color that black tea is famous for, and significantly altering their flavor profile. A brewed black tea can range in color from amber to red to dark brown, and its flavor profile can be anywhere from malty to fruity to roasted, depending on how it was processed. Black tea typically has more astringency and bitterness, but if brewed correctly it should be smooth and flavorful.",
    "description3": "GREEN TEA PROCESSING:   Steaming/Roasting → Cooling → 1st Rolling → 1st Drying (110°C/70°C) → Final Rolling → Final Drying (120°C/80°C). Our green tea is passed through a steaming treatment before rolling. Steaming applies light heat to the leaves to help halt the oxidation process before the leaves are rolled into shape. Steaming also helps expose the fresh, grassy flavor of the leaf. Green tea leaves are not allowed to oxidize after rolling, which is why they remain light color and flavor.",

    "description": "When people talk generally of tea in Western culture, they’re often referring to black tea. Sun tea, sweet tea, iced tea, afternoon tea…these well-known categories of tea are typically made using black tea. Even the popular English Breakfast and Earl Grey blends are made from black tea leaves. This is in contrast to Eastern culture—in countries like China and Japan—where tea typically refers to green tea. So what’s the difference between black and green tea? And how did black tea become so popular in the West? ",
    "description1": "Tea is considered to have originated in China. But it’s the delicate, fresh-tasting green tea that became popular in Eastern society and is still the base of tea culture there today. As tea culture spread and tea was processed for export to trade beyond regions, neighboring countries and eventually across oceans, it was discovered that the more oxidized black tea would retain its freshness and flavor better over long journeys than its minimally oxidized green tea cousin. In the earliest days of border trade between China, Tibet and other neighboring countries, tea was fermented, dried and pressed into bricks to be used as currency. To this day, most of the black tea produced in China is exported out of the country. The Dutch first brought tea to Europe in 1610, it arrived in England in 1658, and then it rose in popularity in England’s American colonies throughout the 1700s. Demand for tea experienced huge leaps in the 1700s as England expanded sugar imports from its Caribbean colonies. By 1800, the English were annually consuming 2½ pounds of tea and 17 pounds of sugar per capita. Some claim it was the increasing trend of adding sugar to tea that spiked the demand for strong black tea over the more delicate green tea imports.",
    "description2": "To understand what makes black tea black and green tea green, it’s important to know that all tea originates from the same exact plant—Camellia sinensis. It’s the variety of tea plant and how the plant’s leaves are processed that define if a tea becomes black or green. BLACK TEA VARIETIES : Camellia sinensis assamica is a larger-leafed varietal of the tea plant that is typically used to produce black tea. Originating in the Assam district of India, it grows in warm, moist climates and is prolific in sub-tropical forests. Camellia sinensis sinensis is a smaller-leafed variety native to China that is typically used to make green and white teas. It evolved as a shrub growing in sunny regions with drier, cooler climates. It thrives in mountainous regions because it has a high tolerance for cold. Hundreds of cultivars and hybrid plants have evolved from these Camellia sinensis plant varieties over time. But technically any type of tea—white, green, yellow, oolong, black or pu-erh—can be made from the leaves of any Camellia sinensis plant. OXIDATION: What makes black tea different from green tea is that during the production process, the tea leaves are allowed to fully oxidize before they are heat-processed and dried. During oxidation, oxygen interacts with the tea plant’s cell walls to turn the leaves the rich dark brown to black color that black tea leaves are famous for. Oxidation alters the flavor profile of a black tea as well, helping add malty, fruity or even smoky notes, depending on the tea. By contrast, when green tea leaves are processed, they are minimally oxidized. After being harvested, they are quickly heated and dried to prevent too much oxidation from occurring that would turn the green leaves brown and alter their fresh-picked flavor. Less oxidation means a green tea is typically lighter in color and flavor than black tea, with more vegetal, grassy or seaweed notes, depending on the tea.",
    "description3": "PROCESSING OF BLACK TEA- ORTHODOX: In this more time-consuming method of production, tea leaves remain whole or only partially broken during processing. Tea leaves are plucked from the garden, withered to reduce moisture, rolled in a variety of ways to bruise the leaves and start oxidation, oxidized to create color and flavor, fired to apply the heat that stops oxidation, and then graded for quality. Black Tea Processing (Orthodox):   Withering → 1st Rolling → Oxidizing/Fermenting → Drying (110°C/65°C). NON-ORTHODOX or CTC (Crush-Tear-Curl): In this sped-up version of the production process, the tea leaves are cut into fine pieces instead of rolled. The smaller pieces of leaves are more quickly oxidized, producing a one-dimensional, consistent, strong and bold black tea. The cut pieces also easily fit into commercial tea bags, which are more popular with end consumers than loose leaf tea. Black Tea Processing (Non-Orthodox/CTC):   Withering → Cutting/Tearing/Curling → Oxidizing/Fermenting → Drying (130°C/90°C).",
    
    "Benefit": "HEALTH HEART: Like green tea, the main benefits of black tea is its high content of flavonoids, which acts as a protection for your heart. Drinking black tea improves blood flow, thus preventing fatal blood clots. It reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases by lowering the cholesterol and blood sugar levels, which will also aid you against diabetes. Another important factor, when it comes to your heart, is that black tea may reduce by 50% the risk of coronary artery disease. Amazing don’t you think? ",
    "Benefit1": "WEIGHT LOSS AID: You may have already heard about diet teas before, so keep in mind that black tea may also help you to lose weight. Antioxidants in black tea combined with caffeine will boost your metabolism, helping you to burn fat faster. Therefore, you can enjoy the benefits of drinking black tea, whether using tea bags, loose leaf black tea or black tea powder, and lose weight by doing some physical exercise as well. That’s not too hard, is it? ",
    "Benefit2": "HEALTHY STIMULANT: Are you looking for a coffee alternative and still feel energetic in the morning? Well, look no further! Black tea has the highest content of caffeine, comparing to the other teas, due to the way it is processed and the leaves that are selected. However, you don’t need to worry. Black tea has less caffeine than coffee (about half), which will diminish dramatically if you brew it multiple times. So what can caffeine in black tea do for you? It may help your memory by enhancing your cognition and sense of alertness. ",
    "Benefit3": "CANCER PREVENTION: Like Green tea, this strong and delicious tea may also help you fight cancer. The presence of flavonoids in black tea help stop cancer growth by scavenging free radicals, which are responsible for the onset of cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. A recent discovery found that TF-2, a compound in black tea, kills colorectal cancer cells and restrains the Cox-2, which produces inflammation. So keep drinking it and have the benefits of black tea act as cancer blocker that will protect your body.",
    "Benefit4": "VIRUS FIGHTER: The benefits of black tea can also make their way to your skin and mouth. Like green tea, black tea may neutralize germs and inhibit the onset of viruses, which cause several ailments such as diarrhea, cystitis, skin infections, herpes, dental plaque, cavities or bad breath. So if you are eager to smile again, without worrying about those horrible viruses, black tea will be a tremendous help. Think of it as an alternative to coffee when eating out at a restaurant. Look at it as a tea tasting opportunity.",

    "description": "White tea is known to be one of the most delicate tea varieties because it is so minimally processed. White tea is harvested before the tea plant’s leaves open fully, when the young buds are still covered by fine white hairs, hence the name “white” tea. These buds and unfurled leaves from the newest growth on the tea plant are handpicked and then quickly and meticulously dried, so the leaves are not allowed to oxidize as long as leaves plucked for green or black tea production. This minimal processing and low oxidation results in some of the most delicate and freshest tea available.",
    "description1": "A tea custom developed during the era of early Chinese imperial dynasties (between 600 and 1300) when tea drinking and tea culture was flourishing across the country. The custom was for citizens to pay a yearly tribute to the Emperors of the time in the form of rare and fine teas. Kind of like a tea tax. This imperial tea tribute was typically made from the youngest, newest and most delicate buds from the finest tea plants. Imperial tea gardens were developed, sometimes in secret, to cultivate these rare, honoring teas. Poets referred to these special teas as being, “white like the clouds, green like a dream, pure like snow, and as aromatic as an orchid.” These imperial tea tributes are considered the earliest forms of white tea, but they aren’t the white tea we know today. During Emperor Huizong’s rule of the Song Dynasty (960 – 1297), young tea buds would be plucked in the spring, steamed and striped of their outer leaf, meticulously rinsed with spring water, carefully air dried and then ground into a silvery white powder. This white powder would be whisked into hot water to create the finest tea available to the only person in China that could afford it—the Emperor.",
    "description2": "It’s important to know that all tea—white, green, oolong, black and even pu-erh—comes from the same Camellia sinensis plant, an evergreen bush indigenous to both China and India. Hundreds of cultivars and hybrids have evolved from the Camellia sinensis plant over time, each thriving in diverse geographical areas of the world. But it’s ultimately the variety of tea plant and how the plant’s leaves are processed that defines the final type of tea that ends up in your teacup. One of the biggest differentiators in how various teas are processed is oxidation—that is, how long tea leaves are allowed to be exposed to oxygen once they’ve been harvested. The longer tea leaves are exposed to oxygen, the darker the leaves become and the deeper the flavor profile that’s developed. During processing, tea masters use many different methods to create and control oxidation, including rolling, shaping or crushing the leaves to speed up oxidation, and steaming, firing or roasting the leaves to stop it.",
    "description3": "WHITE TEA:   Green Bud → Withering (72 hrs) → Drying (110°C/65°C). Our white tea is neither rolled nor fired, so it is essentially non-oxidized and it is the least processed. Instead of being exposed to an artificial heat, the leaves are simply allowed to wither and dry in a carefully controlled environment, which results in the most delicate, fresh-from-the-garden tasting tea. Black tea leaves are harvested and allowed to fully oxidize before they are heat-processed and dried, creating the deep brown to black color and rich, malty flavor black tea is known for. Green tea leaves are harvested and then quickly heated—by pan firing or steaming—and dried to prevent too much oxidation from occurring that would turn the green leaves brown and alter their fresh-picked flavor. White tea is so minimally processed that much less oxidation occurs. As soon as the buds are plucked they are allowed to wither and air dry in the sun or in a carefully controlled outdoor or indoor environment. Some buds may be steamed or exposed to low heat to help dry them more quickly to stop oxidation. Some minimal oxidation occurs as the buds are allowed to dry naturally, but since oxidation is not encouraged manually, white tea has a much softer, delicate flavor profile than its green or black tea cousins.",

    "Benefit": "BURN FAT FASTER: When looking to lose a couple of extra pounds, people often turn to green tea. However, white tea is also a good choice among weigh loss teas, maybe even better! White tea has a concentration of antioxidants that is three times higher than in green tea, so it easily boosts your metabolism, making you burn fat faster. White tea extract also reduces the growth of new fat cells. You just need to add some physical exercise to your life and a balanced diet to see positive and lasting results. Welcome white tea benefits into your life the right way!",
    "Benefit1": "STRONGER HEART: Due to the powerful action of its antioxidants, drinking white tea on a daily basis will lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, while decreasing sugar intake. This means that white tea health benefits include reducing the risk of stroke, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Of course, it is best to drink your tea unsweetened to increase the healing potential of this tea. But with such a delicate drink, you are bound not to need sugar anyway.",
    "Benefit2": "HEALTHIER SKIN: Another one of the amazing white tea health benefits you should consider is the ability of white tea to slow down the aging process. Your skin will look younger, cleaner and fresher as white tea antioxidants reduce the harmful effects of UV radiation on the skin, re-establish the fluid balance and prevent dehydration. Additionally, white tea extract protects the skin from oxidative stress, hence helping against skin cancer. Start protecting your skin today by drinking white tea on a daily basis!",
    "Benefit3": "CANCER PREVENTION: The best way to help prevent cancer is by improving your immune system and reducing the chances of growth of cancer cells. Having a balanced diet and doing physical exercise will help you. This added to the white tea capacity to fight free radicals that damage cells, to reduce viruses and bacteria is a great way to embrace the benefits of tea in your life!",
    "Benefit4": "NATURAL SEDATIVE: What better way to relax after a long day at work than to drink a nice warm cup of tea? Prepare a cup of white tea and delight yourself with the powerful white tea health benefits.

    "description": "Oolong is neither a black tea nor a green tea; it falls into its own category of tea. Yet an oolong may end up with more black tea characteristics or more green tea characteristics depending on the direction the tea master takes in the processing of the tea. Oxidation: Black tea is allowed to fully oxidize during processing, giving the tea leaves their dark color and rich malty aroma they’re known for. Green tea is barely oxidized at all, so the leaves keep some of their original green leaf color and fresh-picked flavor. Oolong tea falls somewhere in between and is often described as a partially oxidized tea. But oxidation levels in oolong can vary from 8% to 80% depending on the production style of the tea master. Which is why the flavor profile of some oolongs may lean more toward a fresh green tea (less oxidized) and others toward a malty black tea (more oxidized).The biggest difference between oolong tea and black or green teas? Oxidation and shape. Shape: Oolong teas are traditionally rolled, twisted or curled into tight balls or thin strands. These artisanal shaping techniques depend on the traditions of the tea master making the tea. Rolling is an important aspect of oolong processing that alters the appearance, color and aroma of the final tea leaves. Depending on how and when the leaves are rolled during processing, the tea master can subtly alter the entire direction of the tea’s final flavor.",
    "description1": "Oolong represents a true artisan mastership of tea processing. The appearance, shape and flavor of an oolong tea can vary wildly depending on the region where it’s grown and how it’s processed. The origins of oolong are claimed in both China and Taiwan and the tea is still highly revered in both countries today. One story claims that the Chinese bestowed the name “wulong” or “black dragon” upon the big dark tea leaves, which were heavily oxidized and twisted into shapes that happened to resemble the mystical Chinese dragon. Another story tells a tale of a tea farmer named Wu Liang (later shortened to Wulong) who discovered the oolong style of tea by accident. The farmer was distracted after a long day of tea picking and upon returning to his withering tea leaves he discovered they had already started to oxidize. No matter which story you believe, it is true that the most famous Chinese oolongs are grown in high mountainous regions over rocky terrain and in cool weather. It is the unique geography and harsh environment that gives these oolongs the rich flavor they are famous for. Taiwan’s most famous oolongs are traditionally less oxidized (10% to 40%) and therefore tend to be greener in color and lighter in flavor than Chinese oolongs. The styles of oolong produced across the country vary just as much as the styles of wine that come out of France. Some oolongs are rolled into small tight balls, while others are twisted into long leafy strands. Some grow in remote mist-covered mountains, while others thrive in temperate bamboo-forested foothills. Some are plucked in spring for a flowery herbaceous flavor, while others are picked in winter and roasted for a hearty woodsy flavor. While the most famous oolongs originated in China and Taiwan, different styles of oolong are being made in other parts of the world today. India, Sri Lanka, Japan, Thailand and New Zealand are just a few of the countries producing some of the world’s oolong teas.",
    "description2": "To understand oolong, you really need to understand tea processing. All tea—black, green and oolong—starts out from the same Camellia sinensis tea plant. The difference in what ends up in your teacup depends on many factors, including the variety or cultivar of the tea plant, the terroir of the plant (the characteristics of the geography, climate and culture), and how the tea leaves are processed after they are picked.",
    "description3": "Because oolong tea is oxidized at varying levels depending on the processing technique of the tea master, its flavor can range from light to full bodied, floral to grassy, and sweet to toasty. The color of the leaves and the hue of the brewed tea can also vary from green to golden to brown. The differences between the types and flavors of oolong teas are often compared to the differences between fine wines. While all wine comes from a grape, it is the combination of the variety of the grape, how and where the grape was grown and the artisanal style of the wine maker that ultimately determines how the wine will taste in your glass. Even within one country’s wine industry, different flavor profiles can be found in different types of wine.",

    "description": "Pu'er or pu-erh is a variety of fermented tea produced in Yunnan province, China. The town of Pu'er is named after the tea that is produced close by. Fermentation in the context of tea production involves microbial fermentation and oxidation of the tea leaves, after they have been dried and rolled. This process is a Chinese specialty and produces tea known as 黑茶 hēichá (literally, 'black tea') commonly translated as dark tea. This type of tea is different from what is known as black tea in English, which in Chinese is called 红茶 hóngchá (literally, 'red tea'). The best known variety of this category of tea is pu'er from Yunnan Province, named after the trading post for dark tea during imperial China.",
    "description1": "Pu'er traditionally begins as a raw product known as 'rough' máochá (毛茶) and can be sold in this form or pressed into a number of shapes and sold as 'raw' shēngchá (生茶). Both of these forms then undergo the complex process of gradual fermentation and maturation with time. The wòduī (渥堆) fermentation process developed in 1973 by the Kunming Tea Factory created a new type of pu'er tea. This process involves an accelerated fermentation into 'ripe' shúchá (熟茶) which is then stored loose or pressed into various shapes. The fermentation process was adopted at the Menghai Tea Factory shortly after and technically developed there. The legitimacy of shúchá is disputed by some traditionalists in contrast to aged teas. All types of pu'er can be stored to mature before consumption, which is why it is commonly labeled with the year and region of production.",
    "description2": "Pu'er tea processing, although straightforward, is complicated by the fact that the tea itself falls into two distinct categories: the 'raw' Sheng Cha and the 'ripe' Shu Chá. All types of pu'er tea are created from máochá (毛茶), a mostly unoxidized green tea processed from Camellia sinensis var. assamica, which is the large leaf type of Chinese tea found in the mountains of southern and western Yunnan (in contrast to the small leaf type of tea used for typical green, oolong, black, and yellow teas found in the other parts of China). Maocha can be sold directly to market as loose leaf tea, compressed to produce 'raw' shēngchá, naturally aged and matured for several years before being compressed to also produce 'raw' shēngchá or undergo Wo Dui ripening for several months prior to being compressed to produce 'ripe' shúchá. While unaged and unprocessed, Máochá pǔ'ěr is similar to green tea. Two subtle differences worth noting are that pǔ'ěr is not produced from the small-leaf Chinese varietal but the broad-leaf varietal mostly found in the southern Chinese provinces and India. The second is that pǔ'ěr leaves are picked as one bud and 3-4 leaves whilst green tea is picked as one bud and 1-2 leaves. This means that older leaves contribute to the qualities of pǔ'ěr tea.",
    "description3": "Ripened or aged raw pǔ'ěr has occasionally been mistakenly categorized as a subcategory of black tea due to the dark red color of its leaves and liquor. However, pǔ'ěr in both its ripened and aged forms has undergone secondary oxidization and fermentation caused both by organisms growing in the tea and free-radical oxidation, thus making it a unique type of tea. This divergence in production style not only makes the flavor and texture of pu'er tea different but also results in a rather different chemical makeup of the resulting brewed liquor. The fermented dark tea, hēichá (黑茶), is one of the six classes of tea in China, and pǔ'ěr is classified as a dark tea (defined as fermented), something which is resented by some who argue for a separate category for pǔ'ěr tea. As of 2008, only the large-leaf variety from Yunnan can be called a pǔ'ěr.",

This occurs chiefly with black tea that is blended to make most tea bags but can also occur with such teas as Pu-erh, where leaves are blended from different regions before being compressed. The aim of blending is to create a well-balanced flavour using different origins and characters. This also allows for variations in tea leaf quality and differences from season to season to be smoothed out. The one golden rule of blending is this: Every blend must taste the same as the previous one, so a consumer will not be able to detect a difference in flavour from one purchase to the next. ",
    "description1": "There are various teas which have additives or different processing than 'pure' varieties. Tea is able to easily receive any aroma, which may cause problems in processing, transportation or storage of tea, but can be also advantageously used to prepare scented teas. Tea can be flavoured in large blending drums with perfumes, flavourants, or essential oils added. Although blending and scenting teas can add an additional dimension to tea, the process may also sometimes be used to cover and obscure the quality of sub-standard teas.",
    "description2": "The base of your tea blend will be the tea leaves or primary herb you're using - called your base ingredient or primary ingredient. There are two things to concider at this point when trying to decide what your base should be. Look & Taste All teas look and taste different. Remember Monday's post about the differences in teas? If you missed it, refer back to it now so you can get an idea of the differences in look and taste of 'official' and 'unofficial' teas. Now to start, ask yourself what you're looking for in your tea. Do you want something strong and bold? If so, maybe your base needs to be black tea. Do you want something light and helpful in a weight loss formula? If so, green tea is your best bet. Whatever you decide on is what should go into your blend in the largest amount. Not sure what you want or what each of the different teas are really like. You can always buy small amounts of each of the teas, brew them up in different cups, set all the cups in front of you, grab some spoons and start smelling, looking, and tasting each of them to see what you think. Remember to keep notes on each of the teas so when it comes to blending time, you know what each base will be like.",
    "description3": "Alright, here's the fun part... in my opinion. Once you've found the tea or herb that will be the base of your blend, it's time to start adding to it. This can be by adding another, smaller amount of a different tea or herb (a secondary ingredient) or by trying out fruits, flowers, foods, and other herbs with it. There's really no limit to the blends you can create. All it takes is patience in trying things out and seeing if you like them or not. If you want to go with another tea or herb for your secondary ingredient, start by taking one tablespoon of your primary tea or herb and adding in one teaspoon of your secondary tea or herb. Taste it and see what you think. If it's not what you want, try something else. If it works together, you can either leave it as is or add more ingredients to your blend. If you're trying to add fruits, flowers, foods, or other herbs... you're going to have to consider their taste and the way they look, then you're going to have to try it out and experiment. Find out what you like together. Have a friend taste it and see what they think. When you come up with the perfect blend, package it correctly for storage (more on how to do that Friday), and put it away to enjoy later.",

    "description1": "Dongting Mountain in Jiangsu has a very long history of producing tea.  When tea trees grew very well people began to pick it as a competition.  The boxes which are used to put the fresh leaves were so full; they had put the fresh leaves into their arms. The body heat people produced began to warm the fresh tea, and cause it to start giving off a very strong fragrant incense type smells.  People were so surprised at this so they started shouting “Xia Sha Ren Xiang”.  Since then people have called it “Xia Sha Ren Xiang”.  When the Qing dynasty’s Emperor Kangxi made his rounds to Dongting in the south, he tasted this tea and praised its wonderful flavor and aroma declaring thathe loved the tea very much.  However, he thought that the name of it was an indelicate name so the Kangxi Emperor gave it the name “Bi Luo Chun”.  From then on, bi luo chun became and has been known as a royal tea.

Chinese tradition offers three different brewing techniques for the bi luo chun, all of which should be paid close attention to.  The Shangtou method: Fill glass about 70% full of water, then put it in.  This method is suitable for very tender green tea such as bi luo chun and xin yang mao jiao.  The Zhongtou method: Fill a cup one third full of water, put it inside and then pour the remaining water over it.  This method is suitable for tender and loose or tight green tea such as huangshan maofeng and lushan yunwu. The Xiatou method: Place it into the bottom of the glass, and then pour water on top.  This method is suitable for green teas that have bud’s, and the leaves are strong and fat such as Xihu longjing and liuan guapian.",

Older and coarser, Bancha leaves are the ones picked after the second flush of Sencha. As a result, it is considered the lowest grade of green tea. Still, it provides you with many varieties, a total of 22 grades waiting to be discovered. An exquisite woody flavor and a yellowish color embellished with a unique aroma make up the base of the tea that will delight your senses. ",
    "description1": "Bancha Tea is your everyday Japanese green tea with a fantastic and unique flavor and yet still full of wonderful green tea health benefits. This tea is different from other Japanese green teas because it is made from older and larger leaves. Taken naturally, grilled or with roasted cereal grains, this type of tea offers you a wide range of flavors and experiences. It is a great inexpensive tea, strong in flavor but low in caffeine, which makes it the perfect tea for you to drink anywhere and anytime you desire. Bancha tea leaves can be roasted and blended to make up two very surprising subtypes of tea that are so amazing on their own that they have managed to increase the reputation of Bancha itself. These Bancha subtypes are Hojicha and Genmaicha, two beverages that combine the powerful green tea antioxidants with unique flavors.",
    "description2": "HOJICHA: is usually made from Bancha tea leaves, and more rarely from Sencha tea leaves or even Kukicha twigs. This subtype of Bancha tea comes from the Shizuoka district in Japan, where it is roasted in porcelain pots over charcoal at high temperatures. This curious processing technique gives Hojicha its reddish-brown color and an earthy and toasty flavor. Due to the roasting process at high temperatures the level of caffeine and catechins is lower. This is the perfect tea to take during or after meals. It will make you feel refreshed and healthy.",
    "description3": "GENMAICHA: Japanese tea also comes from the Shizuoka district and is made with needle-like Bancha jade-green tea leaves and Genmai, which is roasted rice grain. Genmaicha, or brown rice tea, can also be called popcorn tea due to the rice grains popping during the roasting process. Like natural Bancha and Hojicha, this tea is great to drink it during or after meals. It goes well with all kinds of dishes. Genmaicha will intensify your senses and take you on a fascinating trip. Being a Bancha tea, it has low caffeine content due to the roasting process and the type of leaves that are used. So you can drink it any time you wish, even at night and cherish the tranquility and peace it offers you. Now imagine how amazing this combination is: a fresh grassy flavor and a nutty toasted aroma, embellished with an enchanting yellow-green color.",

    "Benefit": "CAFFEINE ALTERNATIVE: Being harvested later in the season and with tea leaves that are broad and coarse, the caffeine content in this Bancha is very low, so if you are looking for a caffeine alternative, this may be a healthier choice for you.

    "Benefit1": "STRONGER HEART: Bancha tea has a less significant presence of catechins in its leaves than other green teas. Still, it is enough to protect your heart from cardiovascular diseases by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. With less caffeine, Bancha tea puts less pressure on your heart than other stimulants, reducing the risk of palpitations.",
    "Benefit2": "LOSE WEIGHT: As you may know, green tea is a fantastic fat burner and it helps you to lose unhealthy extra weight, if combined with a healthy diet and proper physical exercise. Bancha tea is no exception when compared to other green teas. It is actually highly recommend in macrobiotic diets. It is nutritious and light and its flavonoid content helps you burn fat faster while you perform your daily activities.",

Drinking this tea on a daily basis will help you look younger and fresher. Your skin will be smoother and cleaner, with less wrinkles and dark spots.",
    "Benefit4": "CANCER PREVENTION: When brewing Bancha tea, antioxidants are released into your tea cup and with each sip you will be fighting free radicals, which are responsible for the destruction of your DNA and can cause cancer. Green tea antioxidants are powerful allies that limit the growth of cancer cells and boost your immune system, giving you the upper hand in the fight against cancer and other harmful diseases, mainly caused by bacteria and viruses, through disease preventive action.",

Unlike green teas that have had a long history in this region, Keemun black tea only dates back to 1875. A failed Chinese civil servant brought black tea processing techniques from the Fujian province and started producing black tea in Anhui with prodigious success. Its flavor, toasty with cocoa or red wine notes, soon grew to be greatly appreaciated worldwide, and so it was chosen to be the base of the well-known English Breakfast blend.",
    "description1": "Keemun tea is a Chinese black tea best known for its unique floral fragrance resembling orchids and honey. In terms of tea history, you will find that this could be considered quite a new tea, but it is by no means less wonderful. This Chinese tea is composed of beautiful young thin black shoots of leaves and buds from the tea bush. These shoots are shaped into distinctive tight twists. Processed into a black tea, this beverage has a fruity flavor, almost wine-like matching the bright red color of the brew. With various health benefits this could be your everyday cup of tea.",
    "description2": "Slight variations in the processing method of Keemun tea leaves may render different varieties of this black tea, each with its own unique appeal. ● Keemun Mao Feng – Tea leaves and a bud are plucked earlier for this tea variety than for others. It is a high grade tea with a light and sweet flavor. Experience different tones of this tea by brewing less tea for a longer time (about 7 minutes). ● Keemun Hao Ya – This is another high quality variety of Keemun black tea, with small tea leaves and tea buds with golden tips. It has a strong and intense flavor that is greatly appreciated. ● Keemun Gongfu or Congou – This is a variety of tea created especially for the Gongfu tea ceremony (Gongfu means “with great skill”). Whole leaves are rolled into tight thin twists. ● Keemun Xin Ya – This final variety also uses tea buds picked early in the year. Its taste is less bitter than other Keemun varieties. There is also a variety called Hubei Keemun that comes from the Hubei Province, which means it is not a real Qimen/Keemun tea.",
    "description3": "In the mountainous region of Anhui this tea grows in areas covered by forest, low temperature, high humidity and frequent fog. These are the perfect conditions for growing an amazing tea. ● Harvesting - Leaves are harvested both in spring and summer. Young shoots composed of two leaves and a bud are picked to make this tea. ● Withering - The leaves are then left to wither. In this stage the leaves dry and lose excess moisture, which will allow the leaves to be handled with less risk of breaking. ● Rolling - The flexible leaves are now rolled into the twisting shape that characterizes Keemun black tea. As the leaves are rolled the hidden flavor of the tea is brought forward. ● Oxidation - At this stage the tea is left to oxidize and as with all fully oxidized teas, the tea leaves turn black. ● Firing - The final stage of this processing method is to bake or fire the leaves, removing the last of the moisture still in the leaves, making them crisp.",

    "Benefit": "WEIGHT LOSS TEA: This black tea may help you lose weight by helping to improve your metabolism. If your body is able to process foods faster and get rid of unwanted wastes better, then the amount of fat that is absorbed by your body is smaller. The caffeine in this Chinese black tea also helps you to feel energized to exercise more frequently. So combine tea with a healthy diet to burn fat and build muscle at a faster rate.",
    "Benefit1": "DIGESTIVE AID: More than just boosting your metabolism, this tea also improves your digestion. It reduces the risk of indigestion by getting rid of excess acidity in your stomach. Have a cup of Keemun tea after your meals. This is a tea that pairs well with juicy red meats, but if you are prone to digestive problems, then perhaps you should drink it with simpler and lighter meals.",
    "Benefit2": "STRONG AND HEALTHY HEART: The presence of antioxidants and polyphenols in Keemun tea helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. This tea is said to help lower your blood pressure and reduce the level of LDL (bad) cholesterol in your blood. Improving your blood flow and also reducing your blood sugar levels can help you prevent on the onset of other diseases like diabetes. Remember to keep your tea unsweetened and give it a try.",
    "Benefit3": "COFFEE ALTERNATIVE: As with any other tea, this Chinese black tea contains caffeine which may be beneficial to you to a certain point (read below about the effects of too much caffeine). Caffeine in tea helps you keep mentally alert and physically energized. This tea also contains the L-theanine amino acid, a calming component that reduces feelings of edginess that sometimes can occur when drinking caffeinated beverages. Although Keemun black tea does contain caffeine, it still contains less than coffee. And did you know that the effects of caffeine in tea last more hours in your organism than caffeine in coffee?",
    "Benefit4": "CANCER PREVENTION: Keemun tea is a good source of antioxidants. The presence of antioxidants in your system may help to fight and prevent inflammatory diseases and also may help inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Pollution, stress and unhealthy habits leave your body with fewer defenses against free radicals that harm your cells. Antioxidants are the components that may fight these free radicals and prevent the damage they cause.",

In China and other places around the world tea comes from the camellia sinensis, while in Assam black tea is harvested from the variety camellia sinensis var. assamica. Even though green and white teas are starting to be produced in Assam, the region continues to be known for its black tea. Perfect tropical conditions of humidity, monsoon rainfall and high temperatures allow for tea gardens to flourish here.",
    "description1": "Until the 19th century all tea was harvested from the Chinese tea plant; this meant that tea had to be bought from China or tea seeds or plants had to be transported and planted elsewhere, mainly India. In 1823 Robert Bruce, a Scottish adventurer and failed civil servant, explored the Assam region, low in altitude, situated in the northeast of India, east of the famous Darjeeling region in between Bangladesh, Myanmar and China. Robert found the first camellia assamica growing wild in the region. Dying soon after, the task of sending the plant to the botanical gardens of Calcutta for study would fall to his brother Charles. In 1839 the Assam Tea Company was founded and established tea gardens to begin production of this black tea in the Assam valley. Today, this tea is high appreciated around the world and due to its caffeine content it is preferred as a base for breakfast blends: English Breakfast or Irish breakfast.",

Golden buds with a flowery and spicy odor are blended with the tea leaves. This black tea comes from a different cultivar of the tea plant that grows in this particular tropical region of India by the Brahmaputra River. Full of flavor as well as plenty of health benefits, this is a fitting tea for your morning cup of tea.",
    "description3": "This tea is harvested twice in the year, creating two distinct Assam black tea flushes: ● Spring Flush – the first harvest of Assam tea takes place in March, sometimes until mid-May. The leaf is small and the tea is rich in buds. It is quite rare and unknown. This tea is considered delicate and floral with a light colored brew. ● Summer Flush – this second harvest takes place from mid-May onwards and is known as tippy tea due to the golden tips on the leaves. This is a sweeter tea, darker, full-bodied and generally considered the superior harvest. This is a wonderful tea that has brought great respect to Indian teas and as it is a black tea you may reap a great deal of health benefits with every cup you drink.",

    "Benefit": "Fight Infections and Inflammation: The mineral and antioxidant content of Assam tea may help boost your immune system and build your defenses. This is why a cup of tea a day may help relieve or even prevent disease. So as soon as you feel the first symptoms of the common cold hitting you, bundle up and make yourself a hot cup of tea, sweetened with honey. With luck you may be able to speed up healing and spend less time sick in bed.",
    "Benefit1": "Improve Mental Health: Assam tea is like most black teas in the sense that it contains caffeine, a stimulant that may help you stay awake and concentrated throughout the day. On the other hand, tea also contains an amino acid called theanine that relaxes your mind, allowing you to stay alert, but calm. You will be focused and less fatigued at the same time. This tea is also said to stimulate memory and relieve tension to the brain. Although there are no final studies proving this, some believe that regular intake of black tea may lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.",
    "Benefit2": "Cardiovascular Health: One of the benefits of black tea is that it may help improve your cardiovascular health. Assam black tea is rich in antioxidants that strengthen your blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. As with other types of tea, this Indian black tea may help to break up bad cholesterol and plaque buildup that could be the cause for heart attacks or stroke. If you have a previous heart condition, talk to your doctor about what type of tea is more appropriate for, as Assam tea contains caffeine.",
    "Benefit3": "Weight Loss and Improved Digestion: Drinking black tea on a regular basis may greatly improve a sluggish digestion. By increasing the rate at which your body metabolizes food, this may reduce painful feelings of indigestion. With a faster digestion, your body will absorb less fat or sugars from foods, leading to potential weight loss and reduced sugar levels in your blood. Tea should be taken unsweetened to help with weight loss and as Assam black tea has caffeine, it may be used as hydrating energetic beverage when working out.",
    "Benefit4": "Cancer Prevention: Although the claim that black tea may help to prevent cancer still needs further scientific study, there may be some merit to taking a quick look at this potential health benefit of tea. The antioxidants present in teas like Assam tea may help boost your immune system and also reduce the risk of damage your cells face due to environmental and stress hazards. Less risk of mutation to your cells may mean less risk of tumors and certain forms of cancer.",

    "description": "This white tea is known as Bai Hao Yin Zhen in Chinese, which basically means “White Hair Silver Needle”. The young buds that make up this tea are needle-shaped and covered with fine hairs similar to white down. Silver Needle tea originated in the Fuding and Zhenghe counties in the Chinese Fujian province. Here, this white tea is hand-picked very carefully so the buds are not damaged in the process. The best tea comes from the first flush - or first harvest - that takes place between late March and early April, sometimes taking up just two days out of the year. This is called the imperial harvest.",
    "description1": "Silver Needle tea is a unique and precious white tea. It is in fact considered the best of all white teas and also the most expensive. Unlike other teas, this Chinese white tea is made exclusively of young unopened tea silver buds and no leaves or stems at all. Brew a cup of this tea and experience its mellow light, yet quite refreshing flavor.",
    "description2": "",
    "description3": "What distinguishes white teas from all other types of tea is the minimal oxidation that this tea undergoes. It is in fact considered an unoxidized tea. Oxidation takes place when tea leaves are broken so great care is needed when making white tea so that the buds remain undamaged. Let’s take a look at how this tea is processed once it has been harvested from then tea bush. Withering: The Silver Needle buds are laid carefully in shallow baskets to wilt under the sun for a period that can take as long as 3 days. The best tea is still made this way, but as the weather may ruin a batch of tea, sometimes this process is done indoors with artificial warmth. Drying: Finally the buds are bake-dried at a low temperature and that’s it, the tea is ready to be packaged and shipped.",

    "Benefit": "BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM: Silver Needle tea contains antioxidants that help boost your immune system and build your defenses. The high amount of catechins and flavonoids may prove essential to help prevent the onset of disease. Whites teas such as this one are rich in polyphenols that will keep bacteria and viruses way. So this is a good mild tea once you start to feel the first symptoms of the flu.",
    "Benefit1": "HEARTH HEALTH: Antioxidants present in this tea may also help to promote heart health by lowering bad cholesterol levels and strengthening your blood vessels. This tea may aid in preventing blood clots that are responsible for heart attacks and strokes, protecting heart tissue from potential damage.",
    "Benefit2": "DIGESTION AID: Light and mellow, this is a mild tea that is perfect to improve your digestion when you feel stomach cramps or nausea. With no sweeteners needed, this tea helps to relieve stomach acidity and to detoxify your digestive system. If you are suffering from indigestion or heartburn, then don’t eat heavily seasoned foods. Pair a cup of this tea with a mild steamed dish and relax.",
    "Benefit3": "PROMOTES BODY FAT LOSS: This tea may help you lose weight by boosting your metabolism. This not only means that you will digest your healthy food better, but it may also help your body get rid of unwanted waste materials. At the same time, Silver Needle tea is likely to give you the energy you need to perform the physical exercise you need to get into shape. This tea is rich in caffeine helping you to keep motivated.",
    "Benefit4": "COFFEE SUBSTITUTE: If you are looking for an alternative to coffee, this Chinese white tea may be the right tea for you. It is rich in caffeine, which will keep you alert, but also in theanine, a component in tea that gives your mind a calm awareness. While caffeine in coffee seems like an immediate burst of short-lived energy, caffeine in tea is released in a slower and longer-lasting way into your system. Give it a try, particularly if you are not a fan of strong-flavored beverages.",

White tea is also unfermented and comes from the same bush, but is taken from the unopened buds of the tea bush.",

As trade with China became more difficult, the British began to look for other areas to cultivate tea including regions of India (Assam and Darjeeling) and Africa (Kenya) and managed to begin cultivation by illegally smuggling plants out of China. These “new” areas remain some of the biggest producers of tea to this day.",

As with other white teas, this one is packed with antioxidants that give it an enormous health potential, so come and learn more about this Sri Lankan beverage. Travel to Sri Lanka and have a cup of this wonderful tea.",
    "description1": "Sri Lanka does not have a long history of tea growing like China. In fact, Ceylon tea has its origins in the 19th century when Sri Lanka was still a British colony named Ceylon. When the island’s coffee plantations were destroyed due to an infestation, the British started to tea plantations with great success and for a long time, it was mostly black tea that was produced. From the beginning Ceylon teas displayed high quality and a wonderful flavor. This amazing reputation resulted in the fact that Ceylon tea still keeps the original colonial name as its brand and some of the best known tea companies use this tea in their blends.",
    "description2": "Today, a few tea plantations have started producing Srilankan white tea, particularly in the Nuwara Eliya tea estate near Adam’s Peak. This white tea is considered extremely rare due to the fact that only slightly curved silver tea buds, just over an inch long (~2.5cm) are picked to compose this tea. Also it requires that tea pluckers search for tea bushes that produce these long buds, which are much scarcer than in China, so most estates just prefer to produce other types of tea.",
    "description3": "Making such a unique tea requires care and dedication and while white tea requires minimal processing, this does not mean it is any easier than making other types of tea. ● Harvesting: This tea is grown in high altitudes ranging from 2200m to 2500m and it is harvested just once a year by hand. No machines are used so that the silvery tea buds remain intact. ● Withering: Then it is rolled by hand to create the slightly curved thin silver buds that are left to wither in the sun. ● Drying: The final step in the process is to dry the tea buds preventing any oxidation from taking place and keeping this tea as natural as possible. After sorting and packaging, this tea is ready to be shipped around the world. However, being such a rare and delicate tea it does become expensive specially when compared to machine-harvested black teas.",

Like other teas, this tea also comes from the tea plant camellia sinensis. It comes from two specific tea bushes called Da Bai (Large White) and Narcissus tea bush.",

This tea goes through a careful process that gives it a unique refreshing and fruity flavor. And as a white tea it has enormous health benefit potential.",
    "description2": "Grades of White Peony Tea: In China, the highest grades of Bai Mu Dan offer you leaves covered with a fine, silvery white down, a sweet taste and a light color. High grades tend to be hard to find, but lower grades are likely to be more common, offering you a nutty and smoky flavor, as well as having a darker color when infused. So if you happen to come across a higher grade, do not miss the opportunity to taste it.",
    "description3": "What makes a great White Peony tea is its processing method, a careful set of steps that ensure that this tea undergoes as little oxidation as possible and is kept as natural as possible. ● Harvesting: The tea bud and next two tea leaves are plucked in early spring, before fully opened. The leaves retain a light green-gray color due to the feathery down that covers them. The young leaves are carefully handpicked so that they suffer minimal crushing as it is when the tissue cells break that oxidation occurs and white tea stops being white tea. ● Withering: Then they are simply withered, for about 1 to 3 days in the sun, which is quite long considering that weather conditions have to be just right throughout the whole period. After withering the tea leaves are piled for a very short period of time for minimal oxidation. This is so residual, that white tea is considered generally unoxidized. ● Drying: The final stage of processing before packaging is a careful selection of the tea leaves to be bake dried, resulting in a full bodied tea with greater potency.",

    "Benefit": "Immune System Boost: This is a tea that contains a high level of antioxidants, which naturally help strengthen your immune system. This means bacteria and viruses may have a smaller chance of getting in or surviving in your body. It may also reduce your recovery time when you do get sick. As this tea goes well with honeyed flavor, add a teaspoon of honey when treating a cold or flu. It will help you feel better. A healthy immune system also protects your body from the damage and premature aging that free radicals may cause. So drink a cup of tea every day and have a healthy and nutritious day.",
    "Benefit1": "Stronger Heart: A good white tea like this also contains antioxidants that strengthen your whole circulatory system. It helps both to lower your blood pressure as well as reduce bad cholesterol levels. It helps to prevent blood clotting that can lead to heart problems and stroke. Remember to drink you White Peony unsweetened for a healthy heart.",
    "Benefit2": "Healthy Stimulant: So you would like a coffee substitute but still feel the need for an energy boost? Try a daily cup of white tea as an alternative stimulant. This white tea contains a high level of caffeine, but unlike coffee it is released slowly into your bloodstream and has a longer lasting effect. At the same time is also contains theanine, a compound that accounts for the calming sensation that you feel when drinking this tea. If you suffer from heart disease, speak to your doctor about drinking this type of tea.",

There are many legends behind the name of this oolong tea, of which these are the two most famous ones. Whichever story is true, one thing is certain, the original tea bushes date back quite a few centuries and were first harvested by monks to make a medicinal tea highly valued for its healing properties. These tea bushes produced such high quality tea that Da Hong Pao tea received royal recognition. It was considered the King of Teas and only honored guests were to enjoy a cup of this wonderful oolong tea. Today few of the original tea bushes are still alive. People come to visit these venerate tea bushes much like a tourist attraction. Since 2006 tea picking is no longer allowed from the ancient tea bushes for preservation purposes. So Da Hong Pao tea today comes from tea bushes that were the result of plant reproduction using clippings of the old tea plants. These offspring bushes produce tea of a similar grade, but much more affordable, as the original tea would auction at tea markets for more than the price of gold.",
    "description2": "Da Hong Pao Tea is one of the highest quality Chinese oolong teas and is known for its long history and royal reputation. This oolong tea comes from the Wu Yi Mountains in the Fujian province in China, where the best oolong teas are grown. This tea is composed of beautiful downy buds and one or two leaves. These leaves are tightly rolled and present a greenish brown color. Considered the King of Teas, its rich orchid aroma and wonderful long lasting taste make this high quality tea one of a kind.",
    "description3": "A semi-oxidized tea such as Da Hong Pao tea has to go through several stages to result in a high grade tea which is aromatic and wonderfully flavorful. Let’s take a quick look at the processing of this tea. ● Withering - the highest grades of this tea are harvested for only a few days out of the year and then are spread and left to wither in the sun. This allows for water to evaporate and oxidization to begin. ● Bruising – leaves are shaken to further oxidation. This helps to remove bitterness and balance the flavor of the tea leaves. ● Oxidization – Leaves are allowed to rest as oxidization takes place. This particular oolong tea oxidizes to 40%. The leaves begin to change color from green to a reddish color as the cell structure of the leaves breaks down. A fruity and flowery taste begins to develop. ● Fixing – the leaves are hand-pressed in a hot pan and baked. This step stops oxidization so that it remains an oolong tea. ● Rolling – it is time to roll or twist the leaves into their shape. This twisting process helps to enhance the flavor even further. ● Drying – Using the sun, pan heating or hot air, this step stops any oxidation and helps preserve the tea leaf. ● Firing – The final step to Da Hong Pao tea involves roasting the tea leaves with traditional charcoal or modern electric heat giving the tea a smoky and fruity flavor with a long smooth aftertaste.",

The word Chai actually means tea in Hindi and Russian, which is why this tea is also known as masala chai, a more proper term that means spice blend. This tea has been delighting people around the world for more than 5,000 years. First considered an Ayurvedic tonic, this medicinal tea was, according to a legend, created by a king in an Indian or Siamese court. Tea plants have grown wild in Assam since Antiquity, but, back then, tea was only drunk strictly for medicinal reasons. When the British East India Company discovered the camellia assamica tea plants, they started cultivating tea plantations locally for the British market. So by the year 1900, the tea consumed in Great Britain was mostly from India and Ceylon. Most black teas leaves produced from the camellia assamica plant were steeped into a unique and tasty masala chai recipe. ",
    "description1": "Nowadays, there are many variations according to the region, each one offering not only an amazing experience, but also tremendous health benefits. However, despite producing such high amounts of tea, tea consumption in India was in fact low at the time. Therefore, in an attempt to stimulate tea drinking within the Indian society, the British Indian Tea Association encouraged factories, mines and textiles mills to have tea breaks for their workers. Little by little, tea became a part of the Indian daily life and it is now a key element of this culture that you can now find spread throughout the world.",
    "description2": "Chai tea is an Indian everyday drink and it is common for Indians to delight themselves with 4 cups of it per day. In almost every street corner or even office you will find the chai wallah, chai vendors, who incarnate perfectly this tradition and ritual. They prepare this rich chai over an open fire in small stands and stalls and serve it in clay tea cups called chullarhs or kullarhs. Once emptied, the cups are thrown on to the ground and shattered. Remember the movie Slumdog Millionaire? The main character Jamal K. Malik (played by Dev Patel) was a chai wallah for an Indian support center in Mumbai.",

    "description1": "Tieluohan is a fanciful translation for Iron Warrior Monk or better yet Iron Arhat or Iron Buddha. While “Tie” stands for “iron”, referring to the appearance of the tea leaves, “Luo Han”, stands for “arhat” that comes from the legend behind the origin of this tea. It is said that this tea was first created by a powerful warrior monk with skin that was golden-bronze. The tea was found in a cave near the temple of the Buddhist monks. “Arhat” also stands for the state of enlightenment that Buddhist monks reach. The monks would drink this tea after their spiritual practice. Historical records of this tea date it back to the Song Dynasty in China when this tea was given as a tribute tea, offered as highly honored gift.",

Floral, sweet and with a unique toasty and fruity flavor, this oolong tea is full of richness that may benefit your health on a daily basis.",
    "description3": "This is a semi-oxidized tea, meaning that it does not reach full oxidation like black teas, instead, oxidation remains at 40% to 50%. ● The best harvests are done in spring, when 3 slightly open leaves are picked to make this tea. ● After withering under the sun, leaves are tossed in bamboo trays to induce oxidation by breaking the tissue structure of the tea leaves, and also to begin the twisted shaping process. ● Leaves are then sent to hot machines to stop oxidation and to knead them into their characteristic twisted shape. Once fully dried, leaves are sorted and the final step takes place. ● Tieluohan is a roasted tea (note: not all oolong teas go through a roasting step), which is done either in electric ovens or over traditional charcoal fires. ● Great care is taken to give this tea a toasted nutty flavor without imparting heavy charcoal smells. It may take months to complete this process, usually only finishing by August depending on the weather.",

    "Benefit": "Healthier Heart: A cup of Tieluohan tea a day may help prevent heart disease. This tea is rich in antioxidants that help strengthen your blood vessels and at the same time promotes proper blood flow. Teas rich in antioxidants like this one help to reduce the build-up of bad cholesterol in the bloodstream and also help to regulate your sugar levels.

This is good, because the many components of Tieluohan may help to treat your digestive issues. A nice warm cup of tea may boost your metabolism, lessening the effects of indigestion by reducing acid reflux and helping to break the elements in food faster.

This tea may also help your body to burn fat faster, but it will need you to eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly in order to help you lose weight.",

Once leaves are plucked, processing begins: ● Withering: tea is laid out in the sun to reduce moisture inside the leaf and begin the slow process of oxidation. This oolong tea begins to get its unique freshness. ● Tossing: tea leaves are tossed onto bamboo trays and agitated. This tossing of leaves begins to bruise cell walls inside the tea leaf and enzymes begin the oxidation process and floral aromas begin to emerge. ● Oxidation: leaves are rotated in a bamboo drum and as oxidation takes place the edge of the leaves turns red. This process is halted once the desired moisture, flavor and aroma are achieved. ● Rolling: wrapping tea leaves in cloth, the leaves are then rolled and twisted with the right amount of pressure. This process of “bag rolling” is used to achieve exact oxidation for oolongs teas and shapes the leaves into their pearl shape. ● Drying: one of the final steps in the process is drying the leaves to reduce moisture down to 5% of the content and stop oxidation.",

This pale golden liquor preserves the characteristic nutty flavor of the Darjeeling tea blended with the benefits of a white tea.",

This Indian white tea is made up a bud and two young leaves still with their fine downy hairs that give them the distinctive silver color. Even though the Darjeeling tea plants are descendants of the same Camellia Sinensis plants brought from China long ago, the soil and climatic characteristics of this Indian region have imparted on the tea a particular flavor and fragrance. The continual presence of dry and humid air, sun, monsoon rains and a loamy soil, make the Himalayas the perfect environment to grow this white tea.",

Harvesting is done carefully to make sure that only new unopened tea buds with the two young leaves surrounding it are picked from the top of the bush. This white tea may be picked in the first flush (harvesting) from late February/early March to mid-April, rendering a tea that is delicate and floral. It may also be picked in the second flush from late May to June, resulting in a tea that has a nutty muscatel flavor that is quite refreshing. ● Rolling and Withering: After harvesting, the tea is rolled by hand, carefully not to damage the leaves and bud. Then it is withered in the sun, which can be quite a difficult step in the process considering that the climate in the Darjeeling estates is typically cold and rainy. ● Drying: Once withered, it is then dried under soft heat to prevent further oxidation of the leaves.

    ],"description": "This Chinese white tea was first created in the Fuding county in the Fujian province in China and today is it also grown in the Guangxi province. Shou Mei is also known as Long Noble Life Eyebrow, due to its thin and crescent-shaped leaves that resemble eyebrows. It can also be found under other names or different spellings such as Shu Mee, Sow Mei, Shou Mei Wang, Cha Wang Shou Mei, Longevity Eyebrow or Longevity Eyebrow King.",
    "description1": "Once the tea leaves are harvested they are set to naturally wither under the sun. This tea undergoes almost no oxidation, just a slight natural process that gives it its dark color and bold flavor. Finally tea leaves are dried and packaged careful so as not to damage the leaves unnecessarily.",
    "description2": "Fragrant and sweet, Shou Mei tea is a white Chinese tea characterized by its bold flavor. With a combination of tea buds and crescent-shape tea leaves, this tea contains fewer leaf tips than other white teas. And unlike other delicate white teas, such as Silver Needle or White Peony, a sip of Shou Mei will instantly remind you of the lighter, less fermented oolongs teas.",
    "description3": "This tea is considered a low grade white tea as it uses only a few buds and 2-3 leaves that are plucked after those for White Peony (Bai Mu Dan), thus resulting in darker tea, though with greater strength. What seems to define the similarity of this tea to that of oolong teas is the result of this late harvesting of the tea leaves. Using large, more mature, with full fine hair on the surface, multicolored whole leaves make this a lower grade tea, certainly less expensive than the more refined and rare Silver Needle tea.",

    "Benefit": "Healthy Heart: As with other white teas, one of the most important white tea health benefits present in this tea is the ability to help prevent the onset of cardiovascular diseases. Full of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, this Shou Mei tea may help lower blood pressure, reduce bad cholesterol, improve blood circulation and regulate sugar levels. The simple act of drinking a daily cup of this tea may aid in reducing the risk of stroke, formation of blood clots or the occurrence of heart attacks.",
    "Benefit1": "Immune System Boost: Your body faces constant pressure: pollution, viruses and bacteria are all around and put your health at risk every day. Better that treating a disease is preventing it and you may achieve this by boosting your immune system on a daily basis! Shou Mei tea is a white tea rich in antioxidants that may help to, for example, neutralize the germs responsible for cold symptoms.",
    "Benefit2": "Improve Mental Health: Keeping your brain and memory sharp and active is not only great for the struggles of tomorrow, but it is also important as time passes by and age begins to take its toll. This Chinese white tea contains caffeine, which improves your memory and brain activity. At the same time it contains theanine which helps you to remain calm and focused. This is a relaxing and soothing tea.",
    "Benefit3": "Treat Digestive Problems: One of the great health benefits of Shou Mei tea is the powerful action the antioxidants present in this tea have in relieving stomach acidity and facilitating digestion. Take a cup of this white tea to soothe stomach pains and reduce the risk of heartburn and indigestion when you overindulge in foods that you have a hard time digesting.",
    "Benefit4": "Weight Loss Aid: The combination of antioxidants and caffeine in Shou Mei tea may be the key to boosting your metabolism on a daily basis. A healthy diet and a great tea can help your body rid itself of the unnecessary wastes that cause fat buildup. Remember that this tea will not act alone for you to achieve your weight and health goals. A well-rounded diet and regular exercise are highly recommended. If you don’t enjoy going to the gym, start with a daily brisk walk.",

Lapsang is the area around the village of Tong Mu Guan, in the Fujian province, where this tea was first created. Souchong refers to the tea leaves that are chosen. Whereas other teas use the buds and first two leaves (the Pekoe), this tea is made from the fourth and fifth leaf (the Souchong). These leaves are larger and older and have a different chemical composition.",
    "description1": "Stories differ as to how Lapsang Souchong was first created. During the Qing era, the Wuyi Mountainous region was known for producing great oolong teas. When a passing army delayed tea production, tea farmers decided to artificially dry the leaves over pinewood fires in order to speed up the process so as not to lose the whole crop and still make it to market on time. The result was quite unexpected: a smoked tea. The smoke from the firewood was absorbed by the tea leaves, greatly altering their fragrance and taste. Other versions of the story say that the army was actually invading the region and that the farmers resorted to this quick drying method so that they could move the tea and not have it stolen. Either way, the result was the same: this was one of the first black teas to be created and was much appreciated by Westerners. Today this tea is still produced and exported worldwide.",
    "description2": "Lapsang Souchong Tea is a Chinese black tea native to the mountainous Wu Yi region, in the province of Fujian. Mostly enjoyed at breakfast, this is a tea that is strong, healthy and flavorful. Large, dark twisted leaves make up this wonderful tea, but what sets it apart from all other teas is its amazing smoky flavor and fragrance. No other tea tastes or smells like this one and this is because it undergoes a special step during processing that makes all the difference.",
    "description3": "Lapsang Souchong is traditionally a Chinese tea, but with its growing popularity, other tea regions have started producing their own Souchong varieties. ● Chinese Lapsang Souchong - If you choose a superior grade genuine tea, grown in the Tong Mu village area, you get quite a special tea. Tea leaves are lustrous and shiny with a reddish black color and an aroma of dried Logan. A high quality genuine tea is harvested for a brief period of time, which makes this tea rarer and more expensive. It also stands out from the rest for having a less smoky flavor and a sweeter taste. ● Tarry (Lapsang) Souchong – This variety of Lapsang Souchong tea is grown in Taiwan. It is considered the most extreme variety of this type of tea in terms of smokiness. Tarry Souchong gets its name from the fact that the final drying stage of this tea is done using burning pine tar, which gives the tea a stronger flavor and aroma, even more than the Chinese method.",

    "Benefit": "Weight Loss Tea: Black teas like this one may be great for helping you start your diet. A healthy way of losing weight is by improving your digestion and boosting your metabolism. A cup of this Chinese black tea helps your body to process foods faster, reducing the amount of fat that your body absorbs and getting rid of unwanted waste much faster, too.",
    "Benefit1": "Improving Heart Health: Antioxidants present in black teas like Lapsang Souchong are said to improve your heart health and may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Unsweetened, this tea may help to relieve your blood pressure and bring your bad (LDL) cholesterol and blood sugar levels down. This tea and a healthy diet may be the start to a healthier life.",
    "Benefit2": "Caffeine Alternative: If you are searching for a strong flavored beverage that also contains caffeine, then the smoky notes of Lapsang Souchong tea may be for you. Not as high in caffeine as other black teas, this Chinese tea still contains enough caffeine to make it a good choice to help you feel energized in the morning. Caffeine in tea is released into the bloodstream at a slower rate than caffeine in a cup of coffee, but it may have a longer lasting effect and keep alert and focused for a longer period of time.",
    "Benefit3": "Natural Sedative: If tea has caffeine then how come it makes you feel calmer when you drink it? This amazing characteristic present in Lapsang Souchong as well as other teas is due to the amino acid Theanine. Theanine is released from the tea leaves when you steep your tea. As you drink each cup what this amino acid does is calm you nerves, keeping you alert and yet focused. However, if you are highly sensitive to caffeine you may wish to read the next section.",
    "Benefit4": "Reduce Risk of Infection or Cancer: Lapsang Souchong tea contains antioxidants, polyphenols and vitamins that could help improve your defenses against harmful agents such as bacteria or viruses that can cause painful inflammation or infections. A strong immune system may also help your body fight the damaging effects of free radicals to your DNA and perhaps prevent the growth of tumor cells.",

Ceylon tea actually derives from the Chinese tea plant – camellia sinensis – that was brought to Sri Lanka in 1857. Mass production only began years later when a virus destroyed the island’s main crop: coffee. This is one of the best black teas around: traditional tea picking and processing is still used to preserve quality. It is bolder and darker than most Darjeeling black teas, and lighter than a regular Assam, with less of its malty profile.",
    "description1": "Today tea is grown year-round in Sri Lanka, from the central massif to the surrounding lowlands. This tea is one of the few things that are still referred to by the old British colonial name of Ceylon due to its amazing reputation. Sri Lanka has become one of the largest tea producers in the world and also one of the greatest exporters of teas. It is either sold under the name of the estate when tea comes from a single origin or as blend under the Ceylon tea name label. Ceylon black tea has also found its way to some great breakfast and fruit blends as well as being one of the bases of the world famous Earl Grey tea.",
    "description2": "Ceylon black tea is the name given to black teas grown in the island of Sri Lanka. These beautiful teas vary greatly according to the tea garden where they are produced. There are several Ceylon tea sub-varieties all with twisted black tea leaves that brew an extraordinary light to dark coppery brew with an amazing flavor perfect for a breakfast or afternoon tea. Healthy, fragrant and delicious, this is a black tea that is present in numerous blends of the best known tea brands around the world.",
    "description3": "This black tea varies greatly depending mostly on the location of the producing tea garden. And tea gardens are classified in Sri Lanka according to altitude. ● High-grown teas – these teas grow in gardens that are above 1200m in altitude. Tea leaves grown in high altitudes are dark brown in appearance and brew a delicate and light tea. These teas are considered to be of very good quality and may be rather expensive. With light golden liquor, these teas are fine, smooth and have delicate floral notes. They are considered more aromatic and sweeter than other Ceylon black teas. The Nuwara Eliya district in central Sri Lanka is famous for producing high-grown teas all year round with exceptional quality. ● Middle-grown teas – tea estates that produce these teas are located between 600m and 1200m in altitude, such as those in the district of Kandy. These teas are a combination of the characteristics of high and low grown black teas. Teas grown here are strong and medium to full-bodied. Aromatic and rich these are quite unique teas in their own way. ● Low-grown teas – these teas are produced in tea estates from sea-level to 600m in altitude, such as those in the district of Galla. Darker and stronger, low-grown teas are typically made up of uniformly superior black tea leaves. Once brewed the leaves turn a beautiful shade of copper. These robust and full-bodied teas are dark red in color. As for flavor, these are hearty and very rich teas, typically used as filler for many tea blends.",

    "Benefit": "Prevent Cardiovascular Diseases: The amount of antioxidants present in Ceylon black tea is very beneficial to improving heart health. Not only is this said to strengthen the heart, but also is may help to lower bad cholesterol and blood pressure. Due to the presence of caffeine in this tea, you should take care before drinking this tea if you suffer from previous heart conditions. Seek the advice of your doctor in this case.",
    "Benefit1": "Weight Loss Tea: Drinking black tea on a regular basis is said to help boost your metabolism and improve your digestion. A nice warm cup of Ceylon black tea after each meal may help sort your digestive troubles. Weight gain is sometimes caused by the inability of your body to process foods properly. Tea helps to boost metabolic rate, helping your stomach to break foods faster and moving fatty elements out of your body quicker.",
    "Benefit2": "Diuretic Tea: This cleansing tea helps to lower blood sugar levels and at the same time it helps to clear away toxins from the kidneys helping them to work properly.",
    "Benefit3": "Coffee Substitute: As a black tea, this Ceylon tea contains caffeine. Caffeine in tea helps to keep the mind alert and focused throughout the day. This caffeine is released into the bloodstream slowly, not causing the jittery feelings that coffee does. Tea leaves also release another amino acid into the water that makes tea the perfect substitute for coffee. This amino acid is called L-Theanine, which has a calming effect on the nerves.",

Rolled into tiny black pellets, the leaves were mistaken for gunpowder grains. At the same time learn how each cup of tea you drink will provide you with numerous green tea health benefits. Taste a wonderful tea in its original Chinese way and then travel around the world to find it inside a famous tea blend that is enjoyed by many people. Can you guess what this blend is?",
    "description1": "We begin our story in China, in the Zhejiang province, during the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907 AD), where this tea was first produced. Originally called Pearl tea, or zhu cha, Gunpowder green tea has been delighting Chinese tea lovers since. Some say, this green tea got its English name in the 18th century by a British clerk, due to its similarity with gunpowder pellets. Others say that it was the very British sailors that were taking this tea from China all the way to the West. In the beginning green tea leaves were picked by hand and then withered to remove moisture, steamed and then rolled into tiny pellets, again by hand, very carefully so as not to break the leaf. Nowadays, machines do the picking and rolling, except when preparing higher grades of Gunpowder green tea. This rolling method allows the leaves to stay fresh longer than other teas, retaining more flavor and aroma while protecting the leaves from possible damage.",
    "description2": "Moving forward to the present day we find that Gunpowder tea is produced not only in the Zhejiang Province, but also in the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Anhui, Hunan and Fujian. And we can also find it outside China. Therefore, depending on the type of leaves used and where they came from, you can enjoy several types of Gunpowder green tea. Here are some varieties you can try: ● Pingshui Gunpowder:  is the most common variety and it is usually sold as Temple of Heaven Gunpowder or Pinhead Gunpowder. Pingshui is the name of the town in the Zhejiang province where this tea was first grown. It is only fitting that Chinese varieties of Gunpowder tea still take its name today, don’t you think? With this particular variety of tea you will enjoy a more powerful aroma, color and larger pellets. ● Formosa Gunpowder: is grown in Taiwan and it stands out for having its own character. Its fragrance differs from Gunpowder green tea grown in the Zhejiang Province, because the processing method behind this tea is very close to that of Taiwanese oolong tea. This is why Formosa Gunpowder resembles in taste and fragrance to fresh or roasted oolongs. ● Ceylon Gunpowder is produced in Sri Lanka at high altitudes (approx. 1.800m). Though this country produces mainly black tea, green varieties of tea are being produced using the same rolled leaf method that characterizes this tea.",
    "description3": "Unlike other green teas, such as Sencha tea or Bancha tea, this peculiar drink is unroasted and denser than most teas. It is refreshing, magical and it offers you a soft honey taste, followed by a smoky hint. This smokiness so common in this type of tea is also the result of the leaves that are used to make it. While some finer teas use the bud and first small leaves of the tea plant, to make Gunpowder tea pellets, the tea pickers choose larger and older tea leaves. This is a strong characteristic that you may also find in Lapsang Souchong tea, a Chinese black tea.",

    "Benefit": "Fight Cardiovascular Diseases: Gunpowder green tea, like all green tea, is extremely rich in antioxidants, especially catechins and the most abundant is the EGCG. Green tea antioxidants have the ability to inhibit the enzymes that produce free radicals, thus preventing the development of cardiovascular diseases. Green tea can also reduce the chance of having coronary artery disease. It inhibits atherosclerosis and prevents the formation of blood clots! ",
    "Benefit1": "Cancer Prevention: Destroying free radicals, this green tea inhibits the necessary enzymes to the growth of cancer cells. The combination of flavonoids, catechins and minerals strengthen your metabolism and make it much stronger to fight cancer.",
    "Benefit2": "Prevent Type II Diabetes: Studies have shown that if you suffer from diabetes, drinking green tea may improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensibility. Combine a daily cup of Gunpowder tea with healthy eating habits and you may be preventing type II diabetes! How amazing is that? Green tea tastes better unsweetened, so it is a great way to lower your sugar intake!",
    "Benefit3": "Promotes Fat Loss: How to lose body fat in a healthy and fast way? Well, as you know there aren’t miracle diets but this Chinese weight loss tea may help you. Gunpowder tea, as a green tea, combines three major allies that burn fat and build muscle: catechins, caffeine and theanine. Together, they will boost your metabolism and allow you to burn fat much faster. It is a great coffee alternative since it has more caffeine than other green teas, 35-40mg per serving. It will increase your exercise endurance and you will burn more fat in a healthier way! ",
    "Benefit4": "Fight Flu Symptoms: Sneezing, coughing or fever… Are you feeling symptoms of flu coming? Don’t worry. The key is to fight it as soon as possible, so why not start drinking Gunpowder green tea? Green tea antioxidants, especially EGCG have been known for inhibiting influenza symptoms and reducing the duration of the disease. ",

    ],"description": "First grown in 1835, today this tea is mainly produced in the regions of Yame, Uiji and Asahina in Japan. Gyokuro tea, also known as Pearl Dew or Jade Dew, undergoes a special processing method and is harvested just once a year and then only in certain tea plantations. This makes this Japanese green tea quite expensive and difficult to find, but it is definitely worth the investment and the time. Let’s take a deeper look at the processing of Gyokuro green tea to understand what makes it such a special and different tea.",
    "description1": "Gyokuro tea is considered the most precious and most noble of all teas. Its high grade and premium reputation are the result of the special processing methods that this tea undergoes. With dark green needle-shaped leaves, this Japanese green tea is unique and quite rare. Gyokuro has a sweet, soft marine-like flavor and amazing fragrance. It is unlike that of any tea you have ever tasted and no tea collection would be complete without it.",
    "description2": "Gyokuro tea is grown in different conditions from other green teas. This tea undergoes a special process to alter the chemical composition of its leaves. Gyokuro tea This green tea is grown in a misty and rainy climate at a lower altitude than sencha, a more common Japanese green tea. ● Shading: few weeks before plucking, the tea bush is covered with black curtains or bamboo and straw shades, filtering about 90% of the sunlight. Shading defines the character of the tea by reducing the photosynthesis process and so increasing the chlorophyll content. The leaves become dark green and the tannin content is reduced, making a sweeter and less astringent tea. As a result, you will get a pure and fresh tea. ● Harvesting and Steaming: Only the youngest buds are picked once a year in the springtime, called the first flush, so it is quite a rare tea to find in stores. Once plucked the leaves are immediately steamed to stop the oxidation process and preserve their characteristic flavor.",
    "description3": "● Rolling: Once the Gyokuro green tea leaves are cooled down, they then undergo several stages of rolling in order to soften the leaves, promote drying and to allow them to acquire their delicate needle shape. Drying & Firing: To further reduce their moisture, the leaves are dried again. By this stage, the tea leaves are called 'aracha' and will be sorted into several grades named 'tencha'. The finest grades of tencha will make Gyokuro tea come to life. The leaves are then fired to reduce the moisture one last time, thus making this tea last longer and enhancing its flavor. ● Maturing: Finally the leaves are aged for several months before packaging and shipping to tea shops around the world. This is truly an art that requires dedication, patience and skillfulness, allowing you to experience a truly calming and refreshing moment in the immense world of green tea and its benefits.",

    "Benefit": "Burn Fat and Build Muscle: Drinking unsweetened green tea at meals or during the day may help you to lose any extra pounds you may have and still make you feel energetic and strong. Green tea antioxidants, namely EGCG, speed up your metabolism, burning calories and fat much faster. Combine it with a balanced diet and exercise and you will feel it working every step of the way, improving your overall well-being.",
    "Benefit1": "Lower Cancer Risk: Again thanks to its high content of antioxidants, Gyokuro green tea is able to fight free radicals, which are responsible for the growth of tumors. Gyokuro tea will strengthen your immune system, making it able to fight harmful bacteria and reduce the risk of cancer. Drink this and other green teas on a daily basis to help prevent disease and premature cell aging.",
    "Benefit2": "Mental Alertness: Green tea contains caffeine and theanine, and Gyokuro tea, due to the leaves being less exposed to sunlight than any other green tea, has a higher amount of caffeine than most. However, caffeine in tea works as a healthier stimulant than caffeine in coffee, as it is released progressively throughout the day. This means it will enhance your cognition and alertness, shorten your reaction time, stimulate your heart and improve your concentration.",
    "Benefit3": "Improve Heart Health: Do you wish to keep your heart healthy and strong? Drinking tea on a regular basis is a good way to do it. Every drop of tea fills your body with minerals, nutrients, antioxidants and vitamins that reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, by lowering bad cholesterol (LDL) and regulating your blood sugars levels. Always take your Gyokuro tea unsweetened and it will help lower blood pressure and protect you from dangerous toxins.",
    "Benefit4": "Dental Health: Other good news is presence of fluoride and minerals in your Gyokuro tea. As a green tea it will help clean your mouth. It will act as an antiviral agent, preventing bacterial infections, dental plaque and tooth decay. Your breath will be fresher and you will have reasons to smile because a healthy mouth is the first step to a healthy digestive system.",

    "ff": "White tea is the least processed type of tea. The most “fussy” type of tea is oolong tea.",

    "ff2": "When tea is being poured in China, guests tap two or three fingers on the table three times to show gratitude to the server.",
    "ff3": "Although tea arrived in England in 1657, it did not immediately become popular. First sold in coffee houses, tea was heavily taxed, illegally smuggled, altered, and fought over. It took many years for it to become a quintessential English drink.",
    "ff4": "All tea is made from the leaf of the plant Camellia sinensis. The specific types of tea are made by processing the tea leaves differently.",

At Tea Trekker we are very fond of tea from Sichuan Province, and this is one of our favorite Pre-Qing Ming green teas. It is also one of the earliest teas plucked in China at the beginning of each new tea year. Zhu Ye Qing is a gorgeous tea. Look carefully at this smooth, slim, tiny, slightly curved bud with tiny side leaves – it is a marvel of tea plucking expertise and careful manufacture. This type of carefully-rendered, hand-crafted tea is becoming rare in go-go China today.",
    "description1": "Because of the enthusiasm with which we pursue acquisition of this tea, we have been able to maintain our price on this tea again this year. This is an excellent year for this tea, taste-wise, (due to the little bit earlier start to the season compared to last year) so if you are not familiar with this amazing tea, this could be a great year to ‘discover’ Zhu Ye Qing (or re-discover it if you haven’t tasted it for a while). We are now on our second shipment of this delicious tea, and we think that it is definitely a toss-up as to which of this year’s batches we like better. They are so similar that it is a difficult call, and the great news is that they are both so good that it doesn’t matter.",
    "description2": "In the cup, the liquor has a sweet / mildly astringent flavor reminiscent of delicate spring bamboo shoots and asparagus. These qualities, coupled with the vibrant vegetal aroma and freshness of its early plucking time, gives the tea backbone and structure, like a fine Riesling wine. The taste of the tea flirts with the palate and is a sheer delight. This year (2018) this tea can be steeped light (both in quantity of leaf used and/or time in-the-water) in which case the liquid tea will have a subtle but wonderfully pure flavor. If you prefer more of the vegetal flavor for which this tea is known, then use the traditional amount and steep for the classic two minutes to achieve one of the best cups of Zhu Ye Qing that we have tasted in years…for this is truly a great vintage year for this tea.",
    "description3": "Zhu Ye Qing is a modern-era tea but it is already a classic. Zhu Ye Qing (Bamboo Tips) is the most famous tea made on Emei Shan, which is one of China’s four sacred Buddhist mountains. Here, tea grows in the cool, thin air of high elevation and is surrounded by  vast expanses of bamboo forest. In these forests, nourishing moisture (known as clouds & mist) develops and rises up from the valley in the early morning and evening hours. When we visited this remote tea growing area on one of our tea-buying trips we rode a cable car from the top of the mountain down through a pristine bamboo forest. The silence of the forest was serene, punctuated only by bird songs, insect calls, and the gentle sound of the movement of giant bamboo. The scenery here is stunning and the forest is a study in the graceful movement of many species of giant bamboo growing in the wild.",

    ],"description": "Typical Tibetan tea perpetuates an art of brewing tea that has long disappeared: the art of boiling tea. It is also known as Tibeti or Zangcha in Chinese. While the rest of the world moved on to infusing loose leaf tea, Tibetans still make their tea from crushing a tea brick and cooking or boiling the tea. Finally the tea is churned with other ingredients such as yak butter, salt, sometimes rice, orange rind and spices. The tea brick was a form of transporting tea that was typical of the Chinese Tang Dynasty (618 – 709AD), which consisted of pounding tea leaves into a brick-like shape. This compressed tea cake made it easier for tea to be transported along the eastern trade routes. Tea bricks were so prized that at times they themselves were used as currency by traders. Typically these bricks were made with Pu Erh tea or black teas such as Lapsang Souchong. Compressed tea may still be found today in many different shapes: balls, mushrooms, bowls, and the more common cakes and bricks. Some bricks are pressed with decorative engravings, like real works of art. To use a tea brick, Tibetans break it up in a mortar and then bring it to a boil with other ingredients.",
    "description1": "Tibetan tea is a unique beverage served in the region of the Himalayas. This black tea is enjoyed by the people of Tibet and other minorities around the world. From the shape of the tea, compressed and not loose leaf, to the special ingredients that are added when brewing this tea, Tibetans make a cup of tea suited to their needs that is different to what you are used to. This is savory national beverage that is both nutritional and full of traditional friendliness.",
    "description2": "The Tibetan ethnic group may be found in the Autonomous Region of Tibet, but also in some other provinces in China as well as the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India and Bhutan. And for these people drinking tea is an indispensable part of their daily diet. Due to the harshness of the high-altitude region where air is thin and cold and the land is arid, so vegetables and fruits are hard to come by. Tea is therefore regarded as warming, nutritional and essential. Tibetans themselves are said to brink many cups of this favored beverage every day and offer it to guests whenever someone comes to visit.",
    "description3": "There are different varieties of Tibetan tea according to what is added to the tea and what tea is used: ● Butter Tea – (kyamir in Tibetan) the most famous of Tibetan teas, this is what is referred to as Po Cha. It is basically a staple beverage of brick tea mixed with butter (preferably from yak) and salt. ● Sweet Tea – second most popular variety of Tibetan Tea, especially among the younger generations, living in India and Nepal. Much like Indian chai tea, but with fewer spices and with a different brewing method. ● Black Tea – regular black tea with a small piece of butter on top of the tea. This beverage does not use brick tea. ● Milk Tea – favored by children because this tea is weaker with lots of milk and little caffeine. ● Mang Jha – special tea to be served in monasteries during religious ceremonies.",

    "Benefit": "Gastrointestinal Aid and Weight Loss Tea: One of the best benefits this black tea may have for your health is its ability to improve your digestion and even help in the process of losing weight. Black teas such as this may help improve digestion by reducing gastric acids that cause acid reflux and speeding up the process of breaking up foods in your stomach. By boosting your metabolism, Tibetan tea may not only help with sluggish digestion but also aid with weight loss by making your body rid itself of unwanted wastes and fats much faster.",
    "Benefit1": "Lower Cholesterol: Tibetan tea is made using black tea leaves which are rich in polyphenols. These components are known for their potential benefits for the heart. Drinking tea is said to be helpful more as a preventive measure than as a healing one, as black teas such as this one help to strengthen the heart as well as lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Although it may help prevent blood clot formation, which decreases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as strokes or heart attacks, you have to remember that this tea is made with butter, so moderation may be necessary.",
    "Benefit2": "Energizing Beverage: Tibetans love this tea because it contains a high level of caffeine and it is mixed with elements such as butter and salt that give them the energy needed to face the harsher conditions of the Himalayan Mountains. Caffeine in tea works differently than that in coffee. It released into your blood stream at a slower rate and lasts longer in your blood stream as well. It helps you to keep alert.",
    "Benefit3": "Immune System Boost: When you are sick, consider having a cup of black tea such as this one. It is rich in minerals and vitamins that help you fight off bacteria and viruses. Drinking a daily cup of tea may help both fight disease and build up your defenses so that you do not get sick so often.",
    "Benefit4": "Fighting Free Radicals: Studies have been showing that free radicals, elements brought on by stress and environmental pollution can cause havoc to your immune system, with possible occurrence of tumors and premature aging. To counter this effect, people have started ingesting beverages that are rich in antioxidants, which may be able to slow down or prevent the damage caused by free radicals.

High up in the Himalayas (between 400 to 2000 meters in altitude), these tea gardens present the perfect conditions for growing a unique tea: rich, loamy soil and plenty of rainfall. Unlike other black teas, Darjeeling black tea is not fully oxidized, resembling more an oolong tea although quite different from the actual Darjeeling oolongs. The first tea to be grown in the Darjeeling district was brought by the English from China. These camellia sinensis tea seeds and plants were first planted in the mid-19th century. These original Darjeeling black teas were produced were of such high quality and enjoyed such success that many tea plantations in the region were soon established creating a tea with a reputation of its own. Today teas are sold worldwide either as a blend of many tea gardens under the simple designation of “Darjeeling tea”, or from a single estate with the indication of the tea garden and grade.",
    "description1": "Grown in the slopes of the Himalayas, Darjeeling black tea is considered one of the best black teas in India and in the world. Twisted downy shoots, the tea leaves range from green-chestnut to dark chestnut brown in color. This Indian black tea is best known for its unique flavor: nutty muscatel notes that resemble no other tea. This is the reason why this tea is considered the Champagne of teas. Rich in flavor and in health benefits, this is a tea that you can enjoy every day.",
    "description2": "Darjeeling tea is harvested five times around the year. Each harvest is called a flush and each has different characteristics that affect the color and flavor of your tea. ● First Flush (Spring) - this first harvest takes place between the end of February and the end of April. Tea connoisseurs greatly appreciate this high quality and rate tea. This tea flush is mainly composed of young shoots, called “golden tips” that remain green to brown in color because it is less oxidized than other flushes. This Darjeeling black tea should be steeped for 2 to 3 minutes in slightly boiling water, resulting in an intensely floral tea with notes of peach and honey, and a light yellow color. ● In-Between Flush – Extremely rare harvest that takes place in the beginning of May in certain tea gardens. This Darjeeling black tea blends the greenness of the first (spring) flush and the roundness and maturity of the second (summer) harvest. Brew this tea in nearly boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes. ● Second Flush (Summer) – This is the biggest harvest of the whole year, taking place from mid-May to June, during the warm season before the rains come. Teas produced in this season are of excellent quality, with small darker brown leaves, stronger in flavor, with a mild astringency, and more muscatel and fruit notes, such as citrus and apricot. Brewed with slightly boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes, results in a tea with a darker colored infusion than the first flush tea, more amber or coppery, still not as dark as some black teas. This is a great tea to be enjoyed in the morning or throughout the whole day. ",
    "description3": "● Third Flush (Monsoon) – Between July and September, tea is harvested under heat and the heavy rains of the monsoon. These are not the best conditions to make a great tea. The rainy season accounts for less sunlight, so even though the tea leaves grow faster the resulting flavor is more muted. Leaves in these conditions are less withered and thus become more oxidized than teas from other flushes. Less appreciated by tea lovers, monsoon flushes are destined for iced tea, tea bags or blended with strong spices such as is the case of masala chai. ● Fourth Flush (Autumnal) – This is the last harvest before the tea plants hibernate for the winter. It takes makes after the rainy season, in October to mid-November. Temperatures begin to cool down and the soil gives up its last nutrients before it dries out. The result is a tea with larger leaves that produces a stronger and darker brew, good for all times of the day. This fourth flush tea is considered full-bodied, rich and smooth with less floral notes. It has a flavor resembling ripe fruits with a nutty, even woody, profile.",

    "Benefit": "Digestive Help: Darjeeling black tea contains caffeine that may help boost your metabolism.

This tea is different from all other oolong teas because of the color of the tea leaves. Tight and strongly twisted, the tea leaves are yellow-greenish in color, not the usual dark green, with a hint of white. Bai Ji Guan literally means 'white cockscomb' or 'white rooster crest'.",
    "description1": "Historically, this name was given to the tea during the Ming Dynasty (1368 – 1644) due to the yellow color and crest shape of the tea leaf. The legend that developed around the origin of this tea is somewhat different. It tells the story of a rooster that gave its life to protect a baby from an eagle. A monk seeing this act of bravery buried the rooster and it was there that the first bush of Bai Ji Guan grew.",
    "description2": "Bai Ji Guan is semi-oxidized tea with a light to medium oxidation of 25% to 50%. It is a very rare tea when compared to other teas grown in the Wu Yi Region. This tea is quite rare due to low yield of the tea bush, small leaf size and the late spring harvest time. At the same time, there are few tea masters that have the skills to properly process this exquisite tea. Careful processing techniques are used to bring out the natural sweetness and fruitiness of this tea. This is a delicate tea with a mellow flavor that lasts in the mouth.",
    "description3": "Bai Ji Guan is a Chinese oolong tea that is unlike any other. Sweet, floral and fruity, this is a rare, but wonderful tea. One of the famous Rock teas, it is grown in the Wu Yi Mountains in China. Perhaps it is also the rarest of these teas. Unlike other oolong tea leaves, this oolong tea is made up of tightly twisted yellow leaves that give it its unusual name. Rich in healthy elements and with a wonderful flavor, this tea deserves a spot on your tea collection.",

    "Benefit": "Improved Metabolism and Weight Loss Tea: One of the most important benefits of this oolong tea is its ability to help improve the health of your digestive system. This tea stimulates and soothes your stomach so it may help you to deal with painful indigestion. By speeding up your metabolic rate, your stomach may be able to break down food elements faster and help you digest the essential components you need, while getting rid of wastes faster. This tea may also improve the rate at which your body burns fat. So with a healthy diet and plenty of exercise, a cup of tea after your meals may boost your digestive function to help you lose weight in a healthier way.",
    "Benefit1": "Strengthen the Immune System: A cup of tea a day may also help build up your defenses against bacteria and viruses by strengthening your immune system.

Oriental Beauty tea is a Taiwanese semi-oxidized tea to 60% - 70%, which means that it is a highly oxidized tea, close to black teas. Its fruity and floral aroma and sweet taste make it one of the most distinctive teas in Taiwan. This is a beautiful tea made up of the bud and two leaves on the shoot. These twisted shoots are mostly dark green with silver down covering the buds. Some say that these leaves actually have 5 colors: green, white, red, yellow and brown.",
    "description1": "This tea was first produced in the late 19th century in the Beipu County in Taiwan and it was done purely by accident. The most popular story surrounding the origins of this tea is that a tea farmer found his plantation had been damaged by small green insects, known as cicadas, similar to tiny crickets. The little pests had chewed on the leaves. Instead for destroying the plantation to begin anew as was customary, the tea farmer harvested the tea leaves and processed them anyway. The resulting tea was so surprisingly good that it sold for twice the regular price. At this time Taiwan was beginning to export its teas and Bai Hao Oolong found great acceptance abroad. It is even said that it was the queen of England who, upon tasting this tea, named it Oriental Beauty.",
    "description2": "Oriental Beauty tea is an amazing oolong tea from Taiwan. Twisted shoots of dark green color and silver down make this floral tea. This tea undergoes a unique processing step while the tea leaves are still growing on the bush. Little insects play an important role in bringing out the sweetness and freshness of this tea. Naturally sweet and wonderfully healthy at the same time, this is a tea with a bit of royal history.",
    "description3": "So it seems that the magic behind this particular oolong tea is due to small insects. Let’s find out more about the processing method this tea undergoes. ● Production – Today this tea is mainly produced in the Beipu and Emei, in the Hsinchu County in Taiwan. Production has to be totally free of pesticides to attract the small crickets. ● Green Crickets – these little insects need to be attracted to the tea garden and then need to bite the plant to suck the juices from leaves and stem. This causes the tea bush to react and produce elements that bring out a unique sweet flavor. ● Harvesting – A bud and two leaves are harvested in the summer, this is when the best aromas and sweetness are found in the tea leaves. Due to the very unique production conditions, only half of the leaves may be used. ● Sun Withering – the leaves are spread under natural sunshine to begin the process of evaporation of the moisture inside the leaves, this begins the oxidation process and refreshing aromas are released. ● Indoor Withering – a second stage of withering takes place inside the factory as this tea has more moisture than other tea leaves, so this step takes longer than other oolongs. ● Tossing – leaves are tossed onto a bamboo tray and the agitation helps the oxidation process to really begin as the cell tissue of the leaves begins to break. ● Rolling and Drying – moderate pressure is applied to the leaves and these take shape in the form of twisted shoots. Finally, the leaves are dried in order to stop further oxidation.",

    "Benefit": "Improve Digestion and Lose Weight: A cup of Oriental Beauty tea after your meal may help improve your digestion.

This tea qualifies as a High Mountain tea because most tea gardens are situated in altitudes from 1000 meters to 1500 meters. Made up of a bud and 3 leaves or a cluster of 4 leaves, these soft, tender and lustrous leaves are tightly rolled on the stem into dark green and glossy round shapes. Semi-oxidized like all oolongs, Ali Shan tea is a greener oolong because it traditionally suffers very little oxidation coming closer to green teas that undergo no oxidation at all.",
    "description1": "Grown in Taiwan, Ali Shan tea is considered one of the best high mountain oolong teas. Made up of buds and leaves of tea bushes that grow at altitudes higher than 1000 meters, this tea is the result of the unique terrain and climatic conditions of the Ali mountainous region. Thick and juicy leaves are rich in flavor and aromas that brew a wonderful cup of tea, full of healthy minerals, vitamins and antioxidants. Such richness makes this quite a healthy cup of tea. Floral and fruity this Taiwanese oolong tea is a great addition for any tea collection.",

This is a rare tea so make sure to taste if you come across it. ● Shi Zuo: This area gets its name – 'stone table' in Chinese, - from a megalith found by the first settlers. Located at about 1300 to 1500 meters in altitude, this area has a rich soil and the ideal climate for this oolong tea. Hand-picked and hand-processed, this tea is crafted using traditional methods, creating unique flavor profile.",

He realized it as the best place to start plantations. He bought the land from the royal family. In 1879, Munro formed North Travancore Land Planting & Agricultural Society.

    "ff": "Not surprisingly, China is still the biggest producer of tea and supplies nearly 29 percent of the world’s total, with India coming in a close second.

    "ff1": "Though the Chinese grows the most tea, they are not the biggest consumers. At least not per capita. That would be the United Arab Emirates, whose citizens drink nearly 14 pounds of the stuff every year, putting them ahead of Morocco and Ireland residents.

In 1191AD, a Japanese monk by the name of Esai brought this powdered tea to Japan.

    ],"description": "Korean tea encompasses a great variety of teas, from real tea derived from the camellia sinensis to herbal teas made from a multitude of other herbs and fruits. With a long history, this tea culture was greatly influenced by its two Asian neighbors: China and Japan, throughout the ages both in tea production and tea ceremony. Less known in the West than other tea producing countries in Asia, this country has a strong tea culture today. Tea production is not very high and rarely exported, so tea from Korea may be quite rare to find outside this country, but definitely worth a try.",
    "description1": "The first record of tea in Korean history took place after the 7th century, when the three kingdoms in the Korean Peninsula were united under, the then ruler, Silla. The first tea gardens were planted in the Jiri-san Mountain. It was Silla who helped to introduce the tradition of tea drinking to Korea. His ambassadors to China brought back tea seeds and the knowledge to grow and produce tea. Their study of Buddhism also brought back tea drinking customs and rituals of offering tea to the spirits of monks in Buddhist temples.",
    "description2": "At first, Korea followed the Chinese custom of drinking whisked tea (which is still present today in Japan in the form of matcha), and as time passed, so would Korea adopt the loose leaf tea form along with China. During the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910) tea was also used by the royal family and the upper classes in rituals, whose continued study of Chinese philosophy and customs helped Koreans to follow Chinese tea traditions and culture. Nearing the end of the Joseon era, the use of tea in ancestral rites, known as Charye (tea rites), made its way down to the lower classes.",
    "description3": "Tea rites found their way to present day Korea, although today in memorial rituals for family ancestors most people will offer rice wine instead. It was the Buddhist community that continued to make and drink tea much in the traditional way even when almost nobody else did. Green tea has only become popular among the masses in recent years. Large scale production of green tea in Korea dates back just to the 1970's, but it has been experiencing incredible growth in the recent years. Ready-to-drink teas have made their way to the market and dozens of varieties of hot or iced teas are available to suit any palate.",

This green tea is indeed a world full of elegance, benefits and history, starting with its name.

According to one version, in ancient times, people believed that a dragon lived in the village well, controlling the rainfall. They would actually visit the well and pray for rain. Another legend says that the name Longjing is both the name of a water spring and the name of a temple, where monks planted tea trees.",
    "description2": "Historically, Longjing green tea was not given its name until the southern Song Dynasty (960 – 1279AD), a dynasty that invested in the development of tea production. However, it was only during the Qing Dynasty (1616 – 1911AD) that Dragon Well tea was introduced to the world, due to the increasing interest of the emperor Qianlong (1735 – 1796AD), philosopher and poet, who loved to visit the tea plantations.",
